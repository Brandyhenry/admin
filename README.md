## Current Proposals

None yet. See below for how to make one!

### Contributing New Proposals
The following is given as guidance. It's is not a requirement for starting work on a proposal.

**Please [join the WICG](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/) before submitting new proposals.**

 1. **State the problem**: Write an informal description of a limitation with the Web platform and either post it to <a href="http://discourse.wicg.io/">Discourse</a>, spin up a GitHub repo, or just publish it somewhere (e.g., blog post, gist, whatever you like). This should be something you believe is missing in the platform and would make the lives of developers significantly easier if it were added. It can also be something you've noticed is a recurring development pattern which would benefit from standardization. It's fine if your proposal is totally rough and informal - include code examples, diagrams, or whatever you think helps explain the problem best.
 1. **Join the group**: Before bringing the above to the group's attention, <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">join the community group</a>, which means you agree with the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C's Community Contributor License Agreement</a> (CLA). It's critical if you first <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">join the group</a> or else key members won't be able to review or discuss your proposal. Don't worry if you forget, the Chairs will remind you and hound you till you do :)
 1. **Evaluation**: As a community, we will evaluate if the problem can't be solved already using Web tech. We will also look at how many users of the Web might be affected. This will require collecting data, real world usage examples, etc.
 1. **Use cases**: If need be, we will formalize the above into a use cases document. Such a document can help prove to the community that there is indeed a need for a solution that needs standardization (see the <a href="https://usecases.responsiveimages.org/">Use Cases and Requirements for Standardizing Responsive Images</a>, for example).
 1. **Advocate**: We circulate this with browser vendors and the community at largeâ€”we pitch it to anyone who will listen. Getting everyone on-board and in our corner is critical.
 1. **Specify it**: Once we have buy-in from browser vendors and the community, we put together some rough proposals (e.g., a new HTML element, API, or HTTP header...) and we do an "<a href="http://w3c.github.io/charter-html/request-to-transition.html">intent to migrate</a>": where we move the spec to a W3C Working group to seek royalty free licensing commitments from W3C members (you know, the "free" in "free and open").
 1. **(Bonus points) Implementation**: Help turn the ideas from words on paper into working features in modern browsers.

## Code of Conduct
We operate under the W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/), for which we will:

 1. Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
 1. Never harass or bully anyone verbally, physically or sexually.
 1. Never discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
 1. Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning or insulting behavior or language.
 1. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and acknowledge properly the contributions of others.
 1. Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest.
 1. Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access.
 1. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair behavior.
 1. Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.

The same rules apply to our Discourse instance (see also our [Discourse TOS](http://discourse.wicg.io/tos).

If you experience any violations to the above by any participant, please contact the Chairs or the W3C Head of Communications ([Coralie Mercier](mailto:coralie@w3.org)). To make amendments to the W3C's Code of Conduct, please subscribe to the [W3C Positive Work Environment mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pwe/) or email [Coralie Mercier](mailto:coralie@w3.org).
